## ðŸ”¨ Building

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download ObjectARX**  
   Download the ObjectARX SDK for AutoCAD 2024 from the [Autodesk Developer Network (ADN)](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/autocad/objectarx-download).  
   Place the downloaded files in the `ThirdParty` folder under `ObjextARX2024`.

2. **Install Inno Setup**  
   Download and install the Inno Setup installer program from [Inno Setup Downloads](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).

3. **Run the Build Script**  
   Navigate to the `project generator` folder and run `regenerate.bat`. This script will:
   - Generate project files.
   - Build the solution for the specified AutoCAD versions.
   - Create the installer using Inno Setup.

4. **Locate the Output**  
   After running the script, the resulting `.exe` installer file will be located in the `Installer\Versions` folder.
